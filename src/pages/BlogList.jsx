        "Mental health is no longer a hidden topic â€” and that's largely thanks to Generation Z. Unlike past generations, Gen Z openly talks about anxiety, depression, burnout, and self-care. For them, emotional well-being is not a luxury; it's a priority.\n\nGrowing up in the digital age, Gen Z faces constant pressure from social media, academic competition, and uncertain job markets. But instead of ignoring the stress, they're breaking the stigma and demanding support â€” from friends, families, schools, and even workplaces.\n\nApps for meditation, therapy chats, and mental health awareness campaigns are all trending among this generation. Even hashtags like #selfcare, #mentalhealthmatters, and #it'sokaynottobeokay are now part of their daily vocabulary.\n\nWhat sets Gen Z apart is their courage to be vulnerable â€” to say \"I'm not okay\" and ask for help without shame. And that's not weakness. That's strength.",
